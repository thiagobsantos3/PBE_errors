# Security Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This security audit identifies several critical and high-priority security vulnerabilities in the SaaS application. The most critical issues involve authentication bypass vulnerabilities, insufficient input validation, and potential data exposure through logging.

## Critical Issues (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Authentication Bypass in Password Reset (CRITICAL)
**File:** `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx`
**Issue:** The password reset functionality accepts any access token without proper validation
**Risk:** Attackers could potentially reset any user's password with a crafted token

### 2. Sensitive Data in Developer Logs (HIGH)
**File:** Multiple files using `developerLog`
**Issue:** User emails, IDs, and other sensitive data logged in developer mode
**Risk:** Data exposure in production if developer mode is accidentally enabled

### 3. Missing Input Validation (HIGH)
**File:** `src/pages/Signup.tsx`, `src/pages/InvitationAccept.tsx`
**Issue:** Insufficient validation on email inputs and form data
**Risk:** Injection attacks, data corruption

### 4. Insecure Direct Object References (MEDIUM)
**File:** `src/hooks/useStudyAssignments.ts`
**Issue:** Assignment IDs passed directly without ownership verification
**Risk:** Users could access assignments they don't own

## Detailed Findings

### Authentication & Authorization

1. **Password Reset Token Validation**
   - Location: `src/pages/ResetPassword.tsx:45-65`
   - Issue: Minimal validation of reset tokens
   - Recommendation: Implement proper token validation and expiry checks

2. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Location: `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`
   - Issue: Basic role checking, could be enhanced
   - Recommendation: Implement more granular permission system

### Input Validation & Sanitization

1. **Email Validation**
   - Location: Multiple signup/login forms
   - Issue: Basic regex validation only
   - Recommendation: Implement server-side validation and sanitization

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   - Location: Database queries throughout
   - Status: ✅ Good - Using Supabase parameterized queries
   - Note: Supabase handles SQL injection prevention

### Data Protection

1. **Sensitive Data Logging**
   - Location: Throughout application
   - Issue: User data logged in developer mode
   - Recommendation: Sanitize logs and implement log levels

2. **Data Encryption**
   - Location: Database and transit
   - Status: ✅ Good - Supabase handles encryption at rest and in transit

### Session Management

1. **Session Handling**
   - Location: `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
   - Status: ✅ Good - Using Supabase session management
   - Note: Proper session invalidation on logout

### API Security

1. **Rate Limiting**
   - Location: Edge functions
   - Status: ⚠️ Missing - No rate limiting implemented
   - Recommendation: Implement rate limiting on sensitive endpoints

2. **CORS Configuration**
   - Location: Edge functions
   - Status: ✅ Good - Proper CORS headers implemented

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Critical)

1. **Fix Password Reset Validation**
2. **Sanitize Developer Logs**
3. **Implement Input Validation**
4. **Add Rate Limiting**

### Short-term Actions (High Priority)

1. **Enhance Role-Based Access Control**
2. **Implement Audit Logging**
3. **Add Content Security Policy**
4. **Implement Request Validation Middleware**

### Long-term Actions (Medium Priority)

1. **Security Headers Implementation**
2. **Penetration Testing**
3. **Security Monitoring**
4. **Regular Security Reviews**

## Compliance Considerations

- **GDPR**: Ensure proper data handling and user consent
- **Data Retention**: Implement data retention policies
- **Privacy**: Review data collection and usage practices

## Security Score: 7/10

The application has a solid foundation with Supabase handling many security concerns, but several critical issues need immediate attention.
